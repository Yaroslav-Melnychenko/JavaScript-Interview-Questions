Hello, my name is Yaroslav, I am from Ukraine but I am living in Budapest right now.
I have 6 years of commercial experience working in IT. I used to work with this technologies JavaScript, TypeScript, React, NodeJS, Redux, MongoDB, CSS.
I have experience to build a project from scratch and deliver successful result from concept to completion.

Currently I am participating in Scanovate project that provides our clients life-cycle and identity management.
So, what I am doing now:
- Developing front end components and modules on React. This includes dashboards with huge amount of data, workflow and mobile interaction builders, authorizations processes, and so on
- Developing Node.js API services. In project I used to work with express and mongoDB for writing server side application logic
- Integrated and aggregated different API
- Improved functionality and performance of existing company project

Why I am living current company?
I have been working with my current organisation for four years. I am really enjoed to work in it. But, I feel like I have reached a saturation point in my learning experience in this organisation.
Also there was some reorganization in my current company and they decided almost everyone to be fired. I feel like I'm ready to take on more responsibility.
